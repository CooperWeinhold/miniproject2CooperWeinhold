## Description
This script answers the question of how many aircraft crashes there were for 
Boeing, Lockheed, and Cessna after 1970 to 2009. This data was pulled from
Kaggle's "Airplane Crashes and Fatalities" dataset. The purpose of this is to 
show possible trends over the years as well as compare number of crashes between 
the manufactures.

### Dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt

Download the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/airplane-crashes-and-fatalities

```

### Executing program

```
python main.py
```

### Output
Should create a new folder where 3 separate png files will show graphs 
for the 3 different manufactures.
